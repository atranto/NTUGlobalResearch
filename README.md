## Project Description
Project ‘Human Emotion Analysis’ (original title undisclosed due to confidential information), hereinafter referred to as HEA, is a joint project between NTU SCSE, NTU Psychology in the School of Social Sciences (SSS), and a ministry in Singapore. The duration of HEA is between July 2017 and July 2019.

## Objectives
HEA has two major aims. First, a new credibility assessment technology is to be evaluated for its possible use in screening processes, via a field assessment. The technology entails ocular responses and reaction time.
Second, a corpus of physiological signals which can be used to evaluate the application of such a technology in human emotion analysis and detection is to be developed. Said physiological signals may be collected by wearable devices which measure heart rate, blood pressure, body movement, and skin conductance.

## What is available in this repository

In this repository, the actual datasets collected from test subjects are not available due to confidentiality. Instead, a publicly available dataset with a similar set of variables is provided. In addition, sample Python scripts for analyzing microssaccades and EEG data are available.
